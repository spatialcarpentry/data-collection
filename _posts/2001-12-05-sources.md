# Data Collection

### Credible Data Sources

Not all spatial data is created equal, but there is a host of quality spatial data out there if you know where to look. 
Some elements to look at when evaluating the quality of a data product are:
  
  * Normalization - Do similar datasets have similar formats?
  * Accessibility - How can you access the data?
  * Accountability - Is the organization considered an authority of this type of data?

<br>

####Here are a few data sources to check if you are looking for some spatial data:

<br>

#### [Global Administrative Areas (GADM)](http://www.gadm.org) 
<a href="http://www.gadm.org/img/gadm2_adm1_low.png" alt="GADMN database of Global Administrative Areas"><img src="http://www.gadm.org/img/gadm2_adm1_high.png" width="250px"></a>

"GADM is a spatial database of the location of the world's administrative areas (or administrative boundaries) for use in GIS and similar software. Administrative areas in this database are countries and lower level subdivisions such as provinces,departmens bibhag, bundeslander,etc... GADM describes where these administrative areas are and for each area it provides some attributes, such as the name and variant names[^1]."

#### [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](http://www.usgs.gov)

The USGS has had a long history in mapping, and has provided quality topographic data since maps were hand-drawn. The USGS can provided detailed data delimited by Quadrangle or larger extents through FTP or their EarthExplorer portal. Some notable products include:

  + [National Elevation Dataset](http://ned.usgs.gov)
  + [Digital Orthophotography](http://online.wr.usgs.gov/ngpo/doq)
  + [National Hydrography Dataset](http://nhd.usgs.gov)

#### [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](http://www.nasa.gov)

NASA is the go-to for remotely sensed data due to their history as a leader in satellite data and continued growth in data products offerings. Some useful data products are:

  + [Modern-era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)](http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/merra)
  + [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer (MODIS)](http://modis/gsfc.nasa.gov)
  + [Landsat-8](http://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat8.php)
  + [Global Change Master Directory](http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov)

#### [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](http://www.noaa.gov)

NOAA provides a variety of data products for weather and climate. NOAA has an extensive Thredds catalog of climate data available at [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/thredds/calatlog/Datasets/catalog.html](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/thredds/catalog/Datasets/catalog.html) using the OPeNDAP protocol.

The U.S. Census is the authority on national demographic data and creates standardized datasets for the nation on both census tract and block level.

  + [Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) Products](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html) 
  : TIGER products are spatial extracts from the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER database containing features such as roads, railroads, rivers, as well as legal and statistical geographic areas. The Census Bureau offers (these products) in several file types[^2]."

#### Local and regional governments
 Most states maintain repositories of spatial data characteristic or pertinent to their scope. Some organizations to look for would be state geologic surveys, natural resource departments, city and county governments.

## Exercise

#### Download adminstrative boundary data

For this exercise, we will be subsetting a shapefile of the US states.

The dataset can be found on the [Global Administrative Areas website](http://www.gadm.org/country)

Select *United States* from the Country dropdown and set *Shapefile* as the file format.

![gadmUs]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/gadm-us.png)

Click 'OK' to enter the download screen.

On the next screen, click the blue 'download' link to start the download.

![gadmDownload]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/gadm-download.png)

Select a workspace to save the USA_adm.zip dataset

![gadmSave]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/gadm-save.png)

Unpack the zip archive using your choice of file archival software.<br>
(Note: if you don't have any software to unzip archives, [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org) is an easy to use free application)

Once the archive has been unpacked, you can see the datasets which should include a pdf, a few .csv files and some .shp,.shx,.dbf and .prj files.

![gadm-unzip]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/gadm-unzip.png)

The .shp, .shx, .dbf .prj files make up what we call *Shapefiles*

In order to visualize the data, we will need to open up QGIS.

----

#### Download GTOPO30 elevation data




The DEM can be downloaded from <a href="ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/data/gtopo30/global/w140m90.tar.gz">ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/data/gtopo30/global/w140n90.tar.gz</a>

This tarball can be extracted using an archive extraction application like [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org).

(Note: if you are using 7-zip or winRAR to extract the file, you will have to extract the .gz first. Then extract the .tar file from within the extracted subdirectory.)

If you are using Mac or Linux you can extract the files in the terminal with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
tar -zxvf w140m90.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}
